## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Complete)
- [x] Run `npm install` to apply security updates
- [x] Test application functionality after security fixes
- [x] Verify all validation is working correctly

### Ongoing Security Maintenance
1. **Monthly**: Run `npm audit` to check for new vulnerabilities
2. **Quarterly**: Review and update dependencies
3. **Annually**: Comprehensive security assessment
4. **Continuous**: Monitor security advisories

### Additional Recommendations
1. **Code Reviews**: Implement security-focused code review process
2. **Penetration Testing**: Consider periodic security testing
3. **User Training**: Train users on security best practices
4. **Backup Security**: Ensure database backups are encrypted
5. **Access Control**: Implement user authentication if multi-user support is added

## üö® Important Notes

- All security fixes have been implemented and tested
- Application now has zero dependency vulnerabilities
- Input validation protects against common attack vectors
- Email credentials are now encrypted when stored
- Electron security has been hardened with best practices

The application is now significantly more secure and follows industry best practices for desktop application security.
